This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
# Login page / React


[Lets go to live preview](https://pdoubleu.github.io/login_page/)


React module to log in user, check typed data and register.

## Features

### Reset inputs after some time of idle:
> Once the idle is detected, the countdown starts - any action on the page stops counting down, otherwise all inputs are reset and user is moved back on the first subpage.

### Check user's input
> Implemented type data checker on the client side in React code. For that implementation was used React Hook Form.
